# BTH's best online calculator
That is not even online (i cri)

# What is this

This really POG calculator was written as an attempt to try and understand nonsensical uni lectures in a course all about nonsensical programming. I don't know how it works, why it works, or why it should even work, but it does. It's so good that it even beats the Texas Instrument calculators that are very expensive, although those can draw graphs which this one can't.
